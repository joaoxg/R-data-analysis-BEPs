While playing, you will learn which choices helped you to protect your house and yourself, given the assigned budget and expectations. Check at the top of your screen that you are in the right table, and player code.

At the top, you will also see that every player starts with a satisfaction score and a spendable income that differs per player. When logging in, the savings/debt are the spendable income. When the facilitator starts a new round, the spendable income changes by the round income minus the living costs that come every round but differ per player.

Has anyone in your family recently bought a house? Likewise, in your budget and expectations dropdown, you will see the fixed maximum house mortgage you can afford. Your house expectations translated on a rating from 1 to 10. Take one-minute to check your budget and expectations along with the spendable income and satisfaction scores calculations.

130,1: Introduction,"Natucity offers good protection for river flood and is the best in the game against rain floods. Diketown offers also good protection for river but the lowest for rain. Unbesvillage offers similar protection to Natucity against rain floods, but has the lowest for river floods. What is your budget and expectations? Every round, you receive income and pay living costs. Keep about 50k in savings for the round mortgage, taxes, improvements, and unpredictable damage. Otherwise, you may pay a debt penalty.","Where we move on the game map? There are three communities, each is a housing area. Diketown and Unbesvillage has each 10 houses. Natucity has only 7 houses because it has more nature. Not all houses are available to buy at the moment. What do you know about each community? *Natucity offers good protection for river flood and is the best in the game against rain floods.

When more than one player wants the same house, players bid without knowing each other's bid. The higher bid wins. The other player choose among the remaining houses. You can move now and in the last round when new houses become available again. You can always improve your house rating when making house improvements. A house rating below the desired one has only one-satisfaction penalty now. Instead, a one-point satisfaction penalty applies every round you are in debt.",1,22
131,2: Flood damages explanation reminder,"For river floods, house damage =  (Community river protection + house river protection) - flood level of the 12-dice throw.  

For rain floods, House damage =  (Community rain protection + house rain protection) - flood level of the 10-dice throw.  

For flood due to river, you pay 4k per damage point deficit and get as much satisfaction as a penalty. An extra satisfaction penalty applies because of the damages in the community. 

For flood due to rain, you pay one-point damage (4k) and one-point satisfaction penalty regardless of the protection deficit.","Any questions on how to calculate the flood damage? *For river floods, house damage =  (Community river protection + house river protection) - flood level of the 12-dice throw.  

For rain floods, House damage =  (Community rain protection + house rain protection) - flood level of the 10-dice throw.  

For flood due to river, you pay 4k per damage point deficit and get as much satisfaction as a penalty. An extra satisfaction penalty applies because of the damages in the community. 

For flood due to rain, you pay one-point damage (4k) and one-point satisfaction penalty regardless of the protection deficit.

133,4: Taxes Naturcity +5k,"*The taxes of Natucity increases by 5. Therefore, you receive a one-time bonus satisfaction of 2 points if you live in Natucity, and you gain 1 satisfaction point as you move there (instead of losing 1 point for moving). For you to look at, ask the facilitator to take out the house cards that will become available this round, some of which have already improvement measures  (D03, D06, D07, D08, N02, N03, N06, U02, U03, U06, U07, U08).*","Nature enhance water quality, reduce air pollution, and conserve natural habitats.
